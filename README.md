# Language-Mastery-Repos
This repository is dedicated to deep exploration and mastery of JavaScript. Its purpose is to go beyond frameworks and libraries to fully understand the language itself—its mechanics, quirks, patterns, and advanced concepts.
Projects and experiments in this repo cover:

Core JS concepts – closures, scope, hoisting, event loop, and memory management

Advanced language features – proxies, symbols, generators, decorators, and metaprogramming

Design patterns in JS – implementing common patterns with idiomatic JavaScript

Performance & optimization – benchmarking, profiling, and memory-efficient coding

Problem-solving – applying deep JS knowledge to algorithms, edge cases, and complex logic

Each entry is structured to document the concept, problem, solution, and lessons learned, making this repo both a personal reference and a public showcase of advanced JavaScript expertise.
