1. Arrays as collections of data

The journal is an array of entries:
[
  { events: ["work", "peanuts"], squirrel: false },
  { events: ["weekend", "peanuts"], squirrel: true },
  ...
]
Each entry is an object, and inside it is another array (events).

👉 This shows how arrays and objects nest together.
